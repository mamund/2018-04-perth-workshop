# 2018-04 Perth API Workshop
## Designing and Building Great APIs

**NOTE: Watch this space!** This repo will be updated occasionally in the run-up to the actual live workshop. Feel free to visit this about once a week to see what's new as a way to help you prepare for a full day of _Designing and Building Great APIs_.

### Overview
This full-day workshop walks you through a complete process of designing and building APIs that both your developers and your company will love. Topic covered include the API Action Lifecycle, Designing and Describing APIs, and the Sketch-Prototype-Build pattern for safely and quickly turning API designs into production-ready deployments.

Guided by a mix of slides and table exercises, attendees will get direct hands-on experience of the entire design-and-build portion of the API lifecycle. Whether you are a designer, software architect, programmer, or project-leader this course will give you valuable experience and timely references to help you and your team success and designing and building great APIs.

### Prerequisites
This is a fast-paced workshop but you don't need to be a rocket scientist to keep up. It is important to understand the fundamentals of HTTP and APIs in general. We'll be working with basic editors and simple build tools that work with Markdown, HTML, JSON, XML, and YAML. It helps to have some experience with NodeJS and to have that installed and configured on your laptop before you show up. All the course materials will be hosted in Github and we'll make extensive use of online editors that support logins using your github, twitter, and other social accounts. 

Each unit has both a lecture and exercise portion. The exercises usually involve group participation. You can complete some of the exercises with just pen and paper, but having access to a laptop connected to the Internet will allow you a much improved experience for the day. Most of the exercises involve editing existing documents in an online editor but, in a few cases, there are opportunities to write some NodeJS in a local instance. But even if you don't have any NodeJS experience, you'll still get a lot out of the course.

### Supplies
Come ready to rock with the following supplies:

 * Pen and paper for taking notes and working on exercises
 * Laptop with Internet access that is loaded with your favorite text editor and (optionally) a working instance of NodeJS
 * A Github account and (optionally) a locally installed instance of git 

*NOTE: There will be a ZIP file copy of all the online content that you can load onto your local machine if you don't have Internet access or git support.*
